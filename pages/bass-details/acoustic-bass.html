      <p>The <strong>acoustic bass guitar</strong> (sometimes shortened to <strong>acoustic bass</strong> or initialized
        <strong>ABG</strong>) is a bass instrument with a hollow wooden body similar to, though usually larger than a
        steel-string acoustic guitar. Like the traditional electric bass guitar and the double bass, the acoustic bass
        guitar commonly has four strings, which are normally tuned E-A-D-G, an octave below the lowest four strings of
        the 6-string guitar, which is the same tuning pitch as an electric bass guitar.</p>
      <p>Because it can sometimes be difficult to hear an acoustic bass guitar without an amplifier, even in settings
        with other acoustic instruments, most acoustic basses have pickups, either magnetic or piezoelectric or both, so
        that they can be amplified with a bass amp.</p>
