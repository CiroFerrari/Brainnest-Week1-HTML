      <p>The <strong>Fender Precision Bass</strong> (often shortened to <strong>"P-Bass"</strong>) is a model of
        electric bass manufactured by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. In its standard, post-1957 configuration,
        the Precision Bass is a solid body, four-stringed instrument usually equipped with a single split-coil
        humbucking pickup and a one-piece, 20-fret maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.</p>
      <p>Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951. It was the first electric bass to
        earn widespread attention and use, remaining among the best-selling and most-imitated electric basses with
        considerable effect on the sound of popular music.</p>
