      <p>The <strong>Fender Jazz Bass</strong> (often shortened to J-Bass) is the second model of electric bass created
        by Leo Fender. It is distinct from the Precision Bass in that its tone is brighter and richer in the midrange
        and treble with less emphasis on the fundamental frequency. The body shape is also different from the Precision
        Bass, in that the Precision Bass has a symmetrical lower bout on the body, designed after the Telecaster and
        Stratocaster lines of guitars, while the Jazz Bass has an offset lower bout, mimicking the design aesthetic of
        the Jaguar and Jazzmaster guitars.</p>
